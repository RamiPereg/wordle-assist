Wordle Assist is a lightweight, Hebrew-first helper tool for solving the Israeli Wordle game.
It generates all  5-letter permutations based on what you already know — and lets you actively narrow them down during a single Wordle game.

The app is intentionally simple, fast, and framework-free, designed primarily for mobile use.
